#1

You are climbing a stair case and it takes A steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Input Format:
The first and the only argument contains an integer A, the number of steps.
Output Format:
Return an integer, representing the number of ways to reach the top.
Constrains:
1 <= A <= 36
Example :
Input 1:A = 2 
Output 1: 2 Explanation 1: [1, 1], [2] 

int Solution::climbStairs(int n) 
{
    int ways[n+1];
    ways[0] = 1;
    ways[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) 
    {   
        ways[i] = ways[i - 1] + ways[i - 2];
    }
    return ways[n];
    }
}
